# Biography
Greetings! I am a post-doctoral scholar in the Department of Computer Science at the [University of California Santa Barbara] (http://ucsb.edu) and am a member of the Natural Language Processing group directed by [Prof.William Wang](http://cs.ucsb.edu/~william/). I obtained my PhD from [Stony Brook University](http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu) under the guidance of [Prof.Steven Skiena](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/). Broadly, my research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Computational Social Science. More specifically, I am interested in developing statistical models for detecting and analyzing linguistic variation in social media with the uber-goal of not only improving natural language understanding but also enable rich user-centric and personalized natural language processing.
